## About me
In this profile, you'll mostly find software written in Rust, which is my favorite
programming language!<br>

I'm a 19 years old, male and brazilian developer. My native language is Portuguese, but I also speak English
fluently and I'm on my way studying Japanese too.

I'm also a bit experienced on blockchain development with [Substrate](https://substrate.dev). My first job was at [InvArch](https://invarch.network) 
and I had a real good time there.

I own a Void server that's been running for a whole year non-stop by now, hosting some Discord bots and some funny websites I made too. Server administration and backend development is for sure one of my skills and I really love it.

My screen name is S0ra, but in professional contexts you may want to call me by my actual name, Matheus.

### What is "Bodia"?
"Bodia" is an abbreviation for "Bom dia", that means **good morning!**

## TL;DR
